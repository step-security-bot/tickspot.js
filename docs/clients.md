## List Clients

This method will return all the clients that have opened projects. This method needs the following params:

- [Required] page, parameter for your request.

```javascript
const result = await tickspot.clients.list(1);
// The result would be something like the following:
[
  {
    id: 123,
    name: "Test 1",
    archive: false,
    url: "https://secure.tickspot.com/87543/api/v2/clients/123.json",
    updated_at: "2022-03-25T18:15:16.000-04:00",
  },
  {
    id: 456,
    name: "Test 2",
    archive: false,
    url: "https://secure.tickspot.com/87543/api/v2/clients/456.json",
    updated_at: "2022-03-26T17:04:22.000-04:00",
  },
];
```

Optionally, You can send a callback to perform an action on the response data. e.g:

```javascript
const callback = (responseData) => {
  responseData.map((clientData) => {
    return {
      name: clientData.name,
    };
  });
};
const result = await tickspot.clients.list(1, callback);
// The result would be something like the following:
[
  { name: 'Client #1' },
  { name: 'Client #2' },
  { name: 'Client #3' },
  ...
]
```
