## List Opened Projects

This method will return all opened projects. This method needs the following params:

- [Required] page, parameter for your request.

```javascript
const result = await tickspot.projects.listOpened(1);

// The result would be something like the following:
[
  {
    id: 16,
    name: "Project #1",
    budget: null,
    date_closed: null,
    notifications: false,
    billable: true,
    recurring: false,
    client_id: 987654,
    owner_id: 123987,
    url: "https://secure.tickspot.com/654321/api/v2/projects/16.json",
    created_at: "2020-04-21T12:35:46.000-04:00",
